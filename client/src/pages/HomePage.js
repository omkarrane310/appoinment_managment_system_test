              I am extremely satisfied with Appointy.
              <br /><br />
              The client booking software makes it super easy for my clients to use and book appointments online with me. I especially love their customer service, they always respond in a timely manner at all hours!
              <br /><br />
              Before the trial was even complete, I had clients scheduled for my service, pay me through Paypal (linked easily) and connect via Zoom (also linked easily).

              Great software to market your appointments on multiple platforms
              <br /><br />
              Appointy’s online appointment booking app is easy to use and also available for free!
              <br /><br />
              I loved the integrations with multiple platforms like Google analytics, adding a book now on Instagram and especially a schedule directly from Google My Business.
              <br /><br />
              Liked how Appointy easily automated my daily tasks by connecting to Zapier! I completely recommend Appointy.

              question: "What is an online booking system?",
              answer: "An online booking system allows the customers to book appointments with you or book your services through an online platform. Such a system allows the business owner/admin to control and oversee the availability of their services and the bookable hours that are available to the customers. An online scheduling software comes with an inbuilt reminder system that helps sending out automated email/SMS reminders to customers. Appointy is an advanced and free booking system that also allows the online booking portal to be customized to mirror your brand."
